Why good daily backtests fail at minute backtests?

<p>I&#39;ve been noticing that with quite a few of the algos I&#39;ve been making lately, they have had pretty solid results when backtested on daily data, but seem to just go belly up right away on the intraday backtests, and I had a few questions about it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does this happen a lot to newbies?<br></li>
<li>Are there any common mistakes or oversights that lead to this happening?<br></li>
<li>Any general strategies for how to prevent it from happening?</li>
</ol>

<p>If it helps at all, the strategies I&#39;ve been working with lately have mostly been experiments using moving averages (simple and exponential) with pretty short periods. Would transaction costs be a part of it?</p>

<p>Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any help!  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Jacob, I assume by &quot;belly up&quot; you mean that the algo has a runtime error and fails when you change the backtest from daily mode to minutely mode.</p>

<p>The answer is that yes, it happens a lot, to newbies and experts both.  We try really hard to make algo writing easy, and we work hard to make the product &quot;smart&quot; so that you can easily get past obstacles and complexities of algo writing.  This is a problem that we didn&#39;t anticipate as well as others.  (The ones we anticipate well are ones that you never noticed!)  We&#39;re working on a few different changes to make this one go away, in particular making sample algorithms all minutely-compatible and by building some smart &quot;run-once-daily&quot; functions that work in minute mode algos.  The new history() command should help, too, by making trailing windows of data in minute mode more easily accessible.</p>

<p>Some general strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t use brittle code like Booleans.  It&#39;s tempting to say &quot;if first run = True&quot; but that fails in many ways.  Find a more robust way to identify your current status.<br></li>
<li>Along the same lines, it&#39;s easy to just say &quot;order 50 shares&quot; but that is brittle in the face of market and algorithm status.  You should think instead of &quot;target position X&quot; and then have helper code that assesses your current portfolio position and issues the commands that gets you to the new, target portfolio.<br></li>

<p>Sorry, I should have been more precise. What I mean is that algorithms that earn solid returns (north of 200% for example) on daily backtests seem to virtually shoot straight down in minute backtests.</p>

<p>Grant, for an example, see the attached backtest.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Jacob,</p>

<p>The first thing I would check is your trading frequency and transaction costs. Unless you specify otherwise the Quantopian backtester applies (non-zero) defaults for transaction costs (<a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage">slippage</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-commission">commissions</a>) to your strategy, if your strategy trades more frequently in minute mode than daily mode then you will incur more t-costs. This can very quickly overpower returns. </p>

<p>Best regards, Jess</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example you can tinker with.  I tried to get TA-lib to work, with no success.  Perhaps someone else can do a better job, and actually show the TA-lib implementation, with the history API.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hello Omar,</p>

<p>I can&#39;t comment on performance of the TA-Lib but it has the advantage of being a quite extensive library of functions including candle pattern recognition. Implementing a moving average in Python/pandas is trivial but implementing the whole library is not. That&#39;s not to say people don&#39;t waste their time trying - see <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ultra-finance/wiki/pyTaLib">https://code.google.com/p/ultra-finance/wiki/pyTaLib</a></p>
