<p>Yes, many popular scientific python libraries are available - including numpy, scipy, and pandas. You can use them as you would in any python code, just import and enjoy:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Thomas, I took a quick stab at a helper function to let you place orders in cash instead of in shares.  Add the following code to whatever project you&#39;d like to take this cash-based order approach and call this new &quot;order_in_cash&quot; function instead of your normal order function.</p>

<p><code>def order_in_cash(data, security, cash):
    shares = cash // data[security].price  
    if shares &lt; 0:  
        shares += 1 # to fix python&#39;s flooring of negative integer division.  
    order(security,shares)  
</code>
One key difference to note, you have to pass in &quot;data&quot; from your handle_data function so that the helper can access stock prices.  Otherwise, it works as you mentioned.  </p>

<p>2) Allow for user groups/ selective sharing of algos. So allow me to share an algo with colleague X, but not post to forum (y, I can just email the code, but it would be nicer to have more of a user group feel).</p>

<p>3) add an option to &#39;winsorise&#39; returns for outlier handling -  a notorious issue with backtests is hidden outliers in returns data - sometimes they are obvious, you trade a stock and it makes 10,000% in 1 day (oops pricing error, currency issue etc) - but sometimes these errors can be hidden. Winsorizing your returns data allows you to set sanity bounds on what returns you think a stock can achieve, so you might say, clip my returns data at -99% and + 2 standard deviations from the mean returns for that time period. Better explained here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorising">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winsorising</a></p>

<p>4) allow me to plot returns to multiple portfolios in one backtest. so e.g. show long book, short book and a market neutral long/short all in one backtest ( i think you guys said you have the whole &#39;data cube&#39; behind the scenes so it is just a matter of plotting more of the data already generated)  </p>

<p>1) The current benchmark is an ETF that looks like the S&amp;P 500.  Yes, we want the benchmark to be configurable.  I think we&#39;re going to squeeze that into the schedule sooner than later.</p>

<p>2) Yes, there&#39;s definitely a feature around partial-sharing that we need to build.  People want to work collaboratively.  We need to solve a way to do that.  We started with all-or-nothing, and we will add &quot;some.&quot;  </p>

<p>3) Wow, that&#39;s new to me, and it makes a lot of sense.   I&#39;ll see if we can get someone to put that into Zipline, and then make it available in Quantopian.</p>

<p>4) This one, I think, we already can do!  (Unless I&#39;m missing something).  In your algo you need to compute all three of those numbers.  Then, add this line to your algo:</p>

<pre><code>record(short=your_short_var, long=your_short_var, neutral=your_neutral_var)  
</code></pre>

<p>And the graph will magically appear in your backtest.  Full <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-record">doc here</a>.</p>

<p>Great feedback, thanks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Being able to change the <em>date from</em>, <em>date to</em> and <em>initial capital</em> directly in the backtest screen would be nice.<br></li>
<li>Being able to change to date format would be nice too (currently it&#39;s MM-DD-YYYY in the IDE screen and YYYY-MM-DD in the backtest screen, I&#39;m more familiar to DD-MM-YYYY or some &quot;universal&quot; format like 01-JAN-2013).<br></li>
<li>Being able to run algorithms from the beginning of day D to end of day D (currently you can only run it from beginning of day D to beginning of day D + 1)<br></li>
<li>Changing the chart&#39;s period from one day to one minute if we run our algorithms on one day only and with minute-based data.<br></li>
<li>Being able to use simple transform functions on minute-based window.</li>
</ul>

<p>That would great to see :).</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi All,<br>
Great work. The features I would like to see are<br>
1, Version control of my algorithm. Many a times I wish I could get back my old change. Cloning the algo for every version creates too many algos to manage<br>
2. More items mapped in the record functions (current limit is 5)<br>
3. Ability to get price at an arbitrary date (for example, if I want to quickly get AAPL yearly perf compared to SPY for last 10 years, I need to run the backtest for the 10 years. There could be other scenarios where we might want to tap into the database to get a single data<br>
4. Use some other stock other than AAPL for examples :) . The user gets thrown off whenever he sees the example and sees the huge gain that his algo gets</p>

<p>Thanks and Regards<br>
Ajay  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Some machine learning models require a repetitive training and validation scheme. A partial answer was already given in the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/machine-learning">ML topic</a> but a quick look doesn&#39;t teach me how to train for example a neural network model with many parameters to train (e.g. neuron weights) and many characteristics to optimise (e.g. number of neurons, hidden layers,...). Ideally, one would be able to perform an cross-validation scheme online.</p>

<p>Secondly, how do you deal with algorithms with high computational demands? With increasing popularity of ML techniques in this domain, models will become more advanced and more computational demanding. What is the limit? Will users have to <em>buy</em> computational power, or will they have to train there models offline on their own computers?</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>My wish list:</p>

<ol>
<li>The ability to run an algorithm in batch mode in the background.  Thomas Wiecki gives a nice example on <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/zipline-in-the-cloud-optimizing-financial-trading-algorithms">https://www.quantopian.com/posts/zipline-in-the-cloud-optimizing-financial-trading-algorithms</a>, where he uses cloud computing to optimize a parameter in an algorithm.  One risk of the current Quantopian backtesting paradigm is that it does not facilitate rapid exploration of the full algorithm parameter space (i.e. the response surface).<br></li>
<li>Full plotting capability, via matplotlib.<br></li>
<li>A secure virtual desktop (running in &quot;the cloud&quot;) that would allow free-ranging access to the entire Quantopian data set.  Basically, this would provide the ability to run zipline (and the browser-based backtester), but with full access to the data.  The desktop should also have access to parallel/cluster/GPU/cloud computing.<br></li>
<li>The backtest output should include an explicit reporting of commissions paid/expenses.  I&#39;ve poked around, and nowhere can I find an accounting of the expenses.  Perhaps something like the expense ratios reported for mutual funds could be adopted?</li>

<p>Machine learning and other parameter optimization methods are definitely on the road map.</p>

<p>As for high computational demand, I think we&#39;re going to cross that bridge when we get to it.  If you have an algo that you want to run that is having performance problems, please share it with us and we&#39;ll see what we can do.  We&#39;re regularly working on our performance.</p>

<p>The ability to plot and otherwise explore the data is also on the list.  Data exploration is very exciting, and it&#39;s also a very big project that we want to do well.  That will come after live trading.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t currently show commissions anywhere.  I&#39;ll look at exposing those.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hello Fawce (&amp; Ben),</p>

<p>I think that Ben is talking about a convenient way of comparing the backtest <em>results</em> of two or more algorithms, not the code (Ben, correct me if I&#39;m wrong).</p>

<p>This is basically the batch-mode functionality that I suggest above:</p>

<ol>
<li>Define a series of runs over N parameters (e.g. in a table or an array within the algorithm).<br></li>
<li>For each run, store the results, along with the corresponding parameter settings.<br></li>
<li>When the batch is complete, notify the user (e.g. an e-mail).<br></li>
<li>Provide the results in an online table and/or a downloadable file for offline analyses.</li>
</ol>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I don&#39;t know what kind of data quantopian has, but an important factor when determining market impact in high turnover portfolios is the depth of the order book. E.g., there may be an asset that almost never trades but the order book is enormous. Take a look at the euribor contract. I don&#39;t mind being 100% of the volume for five minutes because I&#39;m not going to move the market (I may, however, pay the spread). In other assets, there may be huge volume but the order book is shallow and if my strategy is taking liquidity from the market I could be moving the price significantly (significance of course depends on the importance of slippage in the deterioration of my alpha), even if I&#39;m under 10% of the volume (well below the 25% limit quantopian imposes).  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Daniel,</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so familiar with Bitcoin, but it seems like Quantopian would have to take orders in Bitcoin and then convert them to dollars before sending them to Interactive Brokers, right?  Unless IB also accepted Bitcoin...</p>

<p>Is there any precedent for securities trading in Bitcoin?</p>

<p>What about avoiding currency altogether, and just trading shares peer-to-peer?  Bitshares...  Somewhere I think I saw a quote by Fawce that there may be an untapped worldwide market of 10 million individual, retail quantitative traders...if so, maybe they could just trade amongst themselves and cut out the middlemen?  Should be doable (brokerages hold share records electronically, right?), but I doubt that it is part of the Quantopian business plan.</p>

<p>If you look at Quantopian and their funding, I think this kind of thinking will go nowhere, since they are looking to plug into an existing retail business model already established by IB and other online brokers by providing an improved API and backtesting solution...nothing revolutionary, at least for the near-term (but definitely innovative and entrepreneurial).</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Dan,</p>

<p>I suggest a test instance of Quantopian, so that members can assist in testing and de-bugging, prior to release.  Part of the test instance could include an interactive tool for developing test cases and plans, and displaying test results.</p>

<p>You might also consider publishing a build/update/release schedule, with an accompanying change and test report to be published prior to release.</p>

<p>Generally, you need to address the concern voiced by one member that he&#39;ll wake up one day and find that his live trading algorithm is broken (and in a worst-case scenario, losing money due to a unbeknownst change to the underlying code).</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>What I would like to see changed.<br>
1) We need more documentation!<br>
2) Direct portability between Zipline and Quantopian<br>
3) support for alternative asset classes.</p>

<p>These are the three features that have significantly reduced my reliance on Quantopian/Zipline. I am extremely optimistic about Zipline and think it could be an extraordinary tool in my arsenal, however I cant really get off to the races simply because its extremely difficult to explore all of its features. For instance the batch transform is one of the staple features, however the limited documentation and examples are on the Quantopian side so when I try to port a strategy over to Zipline things quickly fall apart. I seldom get on Quantopian simply because I am trading futures not equities and rely on local data. I am currently trying to put together a frankenstein version of Zipline that will allow me to backtest futures, however handling the data and trying to figure out how to use the module are major hurdles. Would love to get any thoughts or input on this.</p>

<p>If you guys decided to implement futures down the line, I dont think you should use continuos time series because no matter how you adjust it, it simply does not reflect reality. Rolling into a further out contract is typically going to have a negative price impact. You should have data for all the active contracts at any given time and let the user determine what contract to roll into via their algo, typically the contract with the greatest OI. Also you need to consider the difference in tick size/value as well as changes in margin. Many of the platforms I have seen in the past assume .01 minimum tick and static margin across time.  </p>

<p>@Daniel When you say use time, I&#39;m not sure what you mean.  I do understand recording a bar on the chart.  </p>

<p>Collaboration is a great feature request, I definitely want to build it.</p>

<p>Are there technical indicators outside of ta-lib, or do you think finishing ta-lib is the right step?</p>

<p>@Jiaming Can you tell me more about what you&#39;d do with the dowloaded data?  I&#39;m not yet understanding what you want to do with a downloaded list.</p>

<p>I agree that it would be awesome to have the SP500 ingredients as a command, but we&#39;d have to license that data from the S&amp;P, and their fees are astronomical.  </p>

<p>@Saravanan Thanks for those suggestions.  I agree that page needs to be easier.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Haven&#39;t read this whole thread but I keep running into an issue where my log.info statements get cut off. Sometimes the log statements themselves reach a threshold and other times I get truncated statements. For example, if I want to print a dataframe with 10 rows and 63 columns I get the following:</p>

<pre><code>DatetimeIndex: 63 entries, 2013-04-08 00:00:00+00:00 to 2013-07-16 00:00:00+00:00  
Data columns (total 10 columns):  
19654 63 non-null values  
19656 63 non-null values  
8329 63 non-null values  
8554 63 non-null values  
19659 63 non-null values  
19660 63 non-null values  
19661 63 non-null values  
19662 63 non-null values  
19657 63 non-null values  
19658 63 non-null values  
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this sort of truncation is a python thing or a Quantopian thing but I am a chronic triple-checker when I&#39;m writing code and I like to print things out and look at what is going on during each frame before moving on. Just a suggestion - maybe add some sort of &quot;extended&quot; log file (possibly one that saves to the user&#39;s desktop after the simulation runs, if that is faster than printing each log message in the log panel)  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Mike - Welcome to Quantopian! Thank you for the feature requests.</p>

<p>Here are some quick answers inline:</p>

<p>1) Could the backtest represent the percentage gain of the actual security as oppose to what appears to be SPY? At the moment I have to bounce from window to window comparing charts to my results.<br>
&gt; I think you are asking for the ability to define a custom benchmark that will show up in the performance chart. If yes, that is on our to do list. Can&#39;t guarantee when you&#39;ll see it - but you will see it.</p>

<p>2) I may have missed this feature but it looks like you can either buy or sell, was hoping it would be possible to short a security?<br>
&gt; We do support shorting currently. The way to sell short is simply to sell shares of a security that you don&#39;t currently own. So for example, if I do:<br>
order(sid(24), -100) and I don&#39;t own any shares of AAPL (sid=24) then the simulation will sell short 100 shares.</p>

<p>3) After-hours ordering.<br>
&gt; Noted as a request - we don&#39;t currently support simulating or trading outside of market hours.</p>

<p>4) Access to the news wire. For things such as earnings reports it would be nice to be able to parse that document, evaluate it and make split second earnings decisions.<br>
&gt; We had a great research talk on this at our last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Algorithmic-Trading/events/106976362/">NYC meetup</a>, it is a very cool idea! We don&#39;t have this built-in to Quantopian currently - but we do have the capability to parse external CSV data using Fetcher (see here: <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help/#overview-fetcher">https://www.quantopian.com/help/#overview-fetcher</a> ). So if you wanted to built a text scraper/parser and feed stock-specific data in that would be possible.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick answer. In my understanding, the backtester always executes the market order at the close of the next bar. In intraday mode, I agree with you that it&#39;s the way to go. However, in the daily mode, I&#39;d like to be able to trade the overnight session (from close to next day&#39;s open) and the day session (from open to close) via market-on-open (i.e., standard market order) and market-on-close orders. I guess it&#39;s a pretty standard feature for many swing traders.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Dan,<br>
I really really want to see better documentation and more examples. My request is also for you all to write the documentation in layman&#39;s terms and not techie terms. I am  hoping you want to help traders who know a little bit of programming to use your site. If you just want techies who want to write trading programs, then probably the documentation you provided is fine. However, for people like myself, who trades and wants to develop computerized systems, we need some help. I will give you an example. </p>

<p>Here is a paper that you all published. <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/quantopian-drafts/blob/master/data-history-draft.md">https://github.com/quantopian/quantopian-drafts/blob/master/data-history-draft.md</a>. Please read the line on What&#39;s Changing... especially some impedance mismatches around using minute data and specifying the parameters in day units. What does impedance means over here? When I did a Google search for &quot;what impedance means&quot;, it returns - &quot;the effective resistance of an electric circuit or component to alternating current, arising from the combined effects of ohmic resistance and reactance.&quot; Please use terms that we can easily understand without having degrees in computer science. </p>

<p>Also, when you publish the examples, please comment them in such a way that someone beginning to program will understand. We need your help and I believe proper and user friendly documentation will go a long way.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help.  </p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. We totally agree that universe selection should have much more data available, and users should be able to define custom criteria for stock universe selection. Quantopian can manage universes using any criteria, but we need the data to drive the filters. We are starting down this road by updating fetcher to allow universe selection to be driven by fetcher data. You can find the proposed spec and ongoing discussion about the updates to fetcher in this thread: <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/proposed-changes-to-fetcher-and-universe-selection">https://www.quantopian.com/posts/proposed-changes-to-fetcher-and-universe-selection</a></p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>How about letting users post their paper trading strategies live for everyone to view.  That would be interesting and encouraging for the competitive people who will want to rank high on that performance list and it will provide a transparent feedback mechanism between users and quantopian.  This could also be useful for generating revenue as eventually people could purchase systems from selected users who perform well and quantopian could keep a portion of the fee.  It is time for more transparency regarding what people are coming up with and who really is confident enough to share their work not just troll around.  </p>

<p>P.S<br>
A ranking system would be great to rank all advertised strategies, also a collective average ranking of all users who post for live viewing could be tracked which could demonstrate if the development of the quantopian community is improving at generating revenue in live markets as time goes on.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Since many Quantopians will keep their best algorithms private I would like a feature where you can keep your algo private but publish statistics (or allow backtest) on it along with a link to allow others to live trade with it without seeing the source code.  Other users could then pay the developer of that algo a fee to live trade with that algo without gaining access to the source code.  This would create a market where individual developers can monetize their work while sharing the benefits with other users.  Quantopian would also create an additional revenue stream by taking a cut of this fee.  This market would create a  <em>strong</em>  incentive to make high quality algorithms that perform well under real trading.</p>

<p>There is some risk that this would reduce sharing but there are many ways incentivize sharing such as an n-year privacy limit for monetized algos similar to patent expiration which balances the individual incentive to make money with the community interest to innovate.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a user could also offer to make their private algo semipublic for a fee (possibly a handsome fee).  Other Quantopians would be allowed to form a group to pool contributions to meet this fee and have exclusive access for some limited period of time.  This would accelerate diffusion of knowledge without immediately degrading the value of an algo.  </p>

While the library is meant to fit my specific needs, the intent is to eventually push all futures related code back into the main branch of zipline. It is extremely alpha, but if it can amass some additional developers the process in which the code is pushed back could be greatly accelerated. I am strongly against continuous contracts so instead you either have to explicitly state which contract you are ordering or define logic on which your algorithm rolls over using the <a href="http://carterbain.github.io/AlephNull/Patching%20Roll%20Method.html">roll decorator</a>. Currently the roadblock is in the performance tracker and is largely attributed to futures margins. It seems no one has a historical database of initial and maintenance margins and no literature seems to exist in developing a margining model for backtesting purposes. Once I can crack this I believe it wont be far off from having futures accessible to everyone on Quantopian.</p>

<p>Ideally, backtest the algo a number of times, say, 10 runs, over different dates and different time periods, and then give the mean returns over these 10 runs. To enable reruns on same dates, we can base the run on some number (which appears random to the user), but actually is a key to start and end dates for running the backtests.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Testing algos (other than very simple ones) on Quantopian is a time-consuming and often painful experience due to the lack of a debugger. Zipline is much easier, but doesn&#39;t use the same data and it&#39;s non-trivial (though not VERY complicated) to transition to Q. As for testing live algos - well, I&#39;m finding that somewhat frustrating due the very painful testing with minute data and to the S L O W loading of algo data (I&#39;ve been waiting 15 minutes and my 10 line test is still &#39;loading data&#39;!). In short, I&#39;d like to see some attention given to the test/debug/live run cycle to make it less frustrating.</p>

<p>A couple of other ideas:<br>
1) Folder structure for algos and/or seamless GIT-based version control<br>
2) I second Grant&#39;s ideas re a cloud-based &#39;virtual-desktop&#39;<br>
3) I&#39;m sure you guys have thought about providing for users to make their algos available for a monthly fee (like C2, Portfolio123 etc). Any chance this might happen?<br>
4) Any chance of extending yr deadline of 31st March? :)</p>

<p>Having said this, I think you guys are doing a great job......  </p>

<p>The version I pasted in the thread can run on both zipline and quantopian,  though the stuff in the github repo are quantopian only at the moment.   I&#39;ll probably add the additional zipline compatabily if I end up needing it, but not yet.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Some things that would be helpful:</p>

<p>1) Minute-level plotting for backtest results, even if only for very short time-period backtests (1 day?) would be extremely helpful in developing and optimizing algorithms.</p>

<p>2) Email/SMS notifications on trade execution, or some kind of daily trade summary for both live-trading algorithms and paper money algorithms. Notifications could be a freemium feature, i.e. subscriptions that give you a certain quota of notifications per day/month with a free tier. Possibly Slack integration too for teams? =)</p>

<p>3) Some kind of source control integration, so we can work on algorithms locally using our own familiar dev environment and push to Quantopian to backtest and deploy. Also facilitates collaboration.</p>

<p>4) A way to run backtests faster. I&#39;m sure serious traders would be willing to pay to use higher end VMs to execute backtests faster. Although there&#39;s a fine line to walk between making paid versions faster vs crippling the free tier. I&#39;m a bit ambivalent about this one but it&#39;s hard for me to imagine that it&#39;d be sustainable for Quantopian to offer completely free compute for backtests forever.</p>

<p>5) Sharing backtest results publicly outside of Quantopian. And allow us to decide whether or not to share the code as well. This will facilitate your most enthusiastic users trying to get you more users through network effects. Right now the only way to do this is to take a screenshot of the backtest page, which is a rather tedious hoop to jump through.</p>

<p>6) More data! Historical data for stocks that have existed for longer than 13 years would be great so we can establish more confidence in our backtest results.  </p>

<p>Note that for each backtest, a copy of the code is stored and is accessible from the results page (upper right, drop down menu, &quot;View Code&quot;).  So, you can add notes within the backtest code, if you want (e.g. a header).  However, the notes would not be available within the research platform, if you are needing them there, since the backtest code is not available there; only backtest &quot;exhaust&quot; can be pulled into the research platform.  </p>

<p>I think that it would be great to visualize the major intra-day performance movements/changes in the backtest chart and not only the end-of-day day-by-day/close price changes in performance. Something similar to the paper-trading performance chart. </p>

<p>It would improve very much the live trading contest algos, as the developers learn how the algos are really behaving in the real world and try to improve them even more.</p>

<p>Please tell me what you think.<br>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@ Austin,</p>

<p>You can save to context, e.g. context.saved_data.</p>

<p>Yet another mystery of the Q: there is no way to get data from the Q research platform into the backtester/live trading.  If there were, then code could be executed in the research platform, with results dumped into a file that could be pulled in for backtesting/live trading.  Or one could run backtests in parallel, pull the results into the research platform, perform analysis, and then use the results for live trading, for example (I suspect that this is the sort of thing &quot;machine learning and genetic algorithms&quot; would need to do).</p>

<p>Some requests:</p>

<ol>
<li>Allow data to flow from the research platform to the backtest/live trading platform.<br></li>
<li>Provide automation tools so that backtests can be run in parallel on the backtest platform, with the ability to vary parameters within the backtest systematically (there is a hack, but it is not so pretty).  I can envision a script that would do everything from the research platform, running the backtests in the background (no GUI).  Effectively, there would be a backtest engine API available in the research platform.<br></li>
<li>In the research platform, expand get_backtest() so that additional data are accessible (e.g. the contents of context and log output).<br></li>
<li>In the research platform, provide an API to pull in paper/real-money trading results (with support for both a stopped algo and one that is still running).  This could include data from IB that are not available on Q, but resulted from paper/real-money trading.<br></li>
<li>In both the research platform and the backtester, provide something like the Windows &quot;Task Manager&quot; to see available computing resources and to monitor and control them.<br></li>
<li>Consider providing a general API for backtest/live trading that would allow users to plug into the platform with their own front end (the GUI is so Web 1.0 dudes...get with the times!).  I realize this has security implications, so maybe it is too much of a stretch.<br></li>

- Git integration (github would be best, but at least a heroku-style git control of the repos)<br>
- More languages<br>
- More functionality in the editor and backtester<br>
- More markets / data / resolution / etc</p>

<p>By the way, some of this seem all related to Quantopian being a highly coupled set of products. I have a code editor, a simple vcs, a market API against which I can trade, a backtester... from the point of view of the beginner this integration is great. But for advanced users, I you could expose the interactions among your components, perhaps I could have algorithms in clojure that I can develop in emacs, push to aws, configure heavily and only then send them to the contest. I think that thinking hard about the architecture and wha&#39;ts best about quantopian might end up freeing you from investing effort in areas that are not core value propositions of your product.</p>

<p>Sorry for the unpolished text, I don&#39;t have a lot of time right now and english is not my first language. I hope it&#39;s somewhat clear and useful, alas.  </p>

Regarding this same issue, it could be nice to have a community &quot;lib&quot; for functions or &quot;methods&quot; to be used recurrently without rewriting everything with new algorithms or ideas.  Something similar of what TA-Lib tried to do.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>To Dan and the Q team;</p>

<p>I think one area that could do with a major upgrade is the performance report of the algo after the back test is run. There are significant number of performance information that is not provided. These could include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Profit factor calculations<br></li>
<li>percent profitable trades<br></li>
<li>win loss ratio of each trade<br></li>
<li>K-ratio<br></li>
<li>return amounts in percent and dollars / weekly/ monthly/ yearly<br></li>
<li>return data vs. fixed initial capital and not just the compounded equity. This is important for any leveraged strategies to see where the maximum dollar draw-down happens in the range.<br></li>
<li>return retracement ratios<br></li>
<li>total commissions paid<br></li>
<li>summary information in the performance report list for all back test so one can quickly see percent draw-downs and Sharpe ratios per back test without having to click on every single one.<br></li>
<li>parameterized  back-tests that can run the back-tests for a range of inputs<br></li>
<li>and many more ...<br></li>
<li>All of the above for short side vs. long trades. This is critical as it shows for long/short market neutral strategy where is the heavy lifting being done when it comes to performance. I.e. is the short just loosing money and acting as a hedge or it has a positive profit factor etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use Tradestation alongside Quantopian and I utilize the portfolio analyzer to run some technical bases strategies. I will email a spreadsheet sample output from this tool. It provides a significant amount of information for the back test. I find this to be critical to closely analyze the performance of the algo. Please review and hopefully you can incorporate this style of performance report in the platform. In particular individual trades list is very useful too.</p>

<p>Thanks  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Is this thread still relevant and actually read by staff to pick ideas to implement?</p>

<p>If so:</p>

<ol>
<li>allow multiple pipelines, this seemed an obvious one since attach_pipeline asks for a name and I wanted separated pipeline outputs for long and short positions, turns out only one instance can be attached; also attach_pipeline is not documented in the API reference;<br></li>
<li>offer a builtin filter matching securities with open positions, they need computed metrics but they don&#39;t necessarily match filters created in initialize(), the result is that one has to implement metrics in Pipeline and at the same time manually re-implement the same metrics in a data handle function thus partially defeating the point of having pipeline engine in first place;<br></li>
<li>provide a mean (http API, Dropbox or GoogleDrive sharing folder, fuse, whatever) of synhronizing the algorithm files; the IDE is not-so-great in terms of editing and offers no versioning at all, it&#39;d be nice to be able to use one&#39;s preferred editor and VCS and then see the change automatically reflected in the algorithms.<br></li>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I like to emphasize the trades list as well. It should contain the trade direction as well a signal name. We could add order(&quot;signal name&quot;, ...) to the syntax so this signal is used for reporting. The trade direction should include;<br>

-cover short</p>

<p>right now we just see buys and sells in the amounts without begin able to tell if the trade is covering a short or buying long.<br>

The first three requests are available in the roundtrip transaction analysis. It&#39;s not yet integrated onto the Quantopian platform, but it will be later.

You&#39;re welcome to submit pull requests to the public repo! </p>

<p>@Andrea - If you want to work separately with your long and short positions, you can but the criteria in separate columns in your pipeline. And then keep it within the single pipline. I think this should work, let me know if I misunderstood your setup :). And thanks for the other requests, a mechanism to share code within your own algos has been commonly requested, I&#39;ll add your +1. </p>

I&#39;m already doing that -since it&#39;s actually the only way to proceed with pipeline- I just added the filters so my pipeline in order to have two boolean, disjoint columns (never both True) that I can use to filter out the resulting dataframe.</p>

<p>My point is that it&#39;s odd requiring users to pass a name but then limit the simulation having just the one.<br>
The sole fact that you need too use a name to fetch pipeline results suggests you can have multiple. I figure the multiple pipeline is a longer-term feature and is now being limited for practicality reasons, but at least document that a little more clearly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re referring about with your &quot;sharing code within one&#39;s own algos&quot; point, I was referring to synchronized algorithm-space between an user&#39;s computer and your platform, not sharing code in-between different algos. To be more clear I&#39;m talking about writing in my own text editor.</p>

<p>My most desired feature tho&#39; is a filter matching securities for which there&#39;s an open position, i.e. the second feature one I mentioned. That would streamline the algos since you can put it all the computation logic in the pipeline once rather than making the same kind of computation twice, one with Factor logic and the other by hand.  </p>

<p>For a given algo, if you navigate to the &quot;All Backtests&quot; page, you can see the backtests underway, and their progress.  However, I am unaware of a consolidated dashboard that shows backtests across algos; one has to navigate to their respective &quot;All Backtests&quot; pages.</p>

<p>One way to crack this nut would be to build the functionality into the research platform (e.g. 
<code>get_running_backtests()</code> which would generate a report on-demand of the current status of all running backtests).  </p>

<p>I find Quantopian difficult to use for technical analysis and this is mainly because of the window_safe option which is set to false (unnessary in my view) in a lot of cases.</p>

<p>For example if I use this:<br>
weekly_close = USEquityPricing.close.latest.downsample(&#39;week_start&#39;)<br>
One cannot use the weekly_close as input to indicators like macd, etc. beacuse window_safe is set to false and there seems to be now way around this.<br>
For technical analysis this is practically something you cannot do without.<br>
Could you at least give us the option to change this as a parameter or change this in some other way because this would be GREAT and basicaly cannot be missed for technical analysis.<br>
Also: I see no reason why window_safe could not be set to true because basically this is just a downsampled version of the close data.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Responding to the above request for setting <code>window_safe = True</code>.  This can be done with a simple custom factor.</p>

<pre><code>class Make_Window_Safe(CustomFactor):  
    window_safe = True 

    def compute(self, today, assets, out, input_factor):  
        out[:] = input_factor

# A factor can be set to &#39;window_safe&#39; and then used as an input to another factor like this  
my_window_safe_factor = Make_Window_Safe(inputs=[my_factor])  
sma_my_factor = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[my_window_safe_factor], window_length=20)

</code></pre>

<p>However, BE CAREFUL. Ensure your factor truly is &#39;window_safe&#39;. What does this mean exactly? Setting <code>window_safe = True</code> flags the factor as invariant over different timeframes or &#39;windows&#39; .  As an example, take the built in factor <code>SimpleMovingAverage</code></p>

<pre><code>my_sma = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[USEquityPricing.close.latest], window_length=20)

</code></pre>

<p>This should produce the average close price over the given window of 20 trading days. On 1-9-2020 lets say the average price for stock XYZ was $20. If this factor were run on 1-10-2020 the average price should generally be pretty close, perhaps $20.10. But, what happens if XYZ has a 2:1 stock split (or dividend) on 1-10-2020? Pipeline always adjusts prices as of the pipeline date. The 1-9-2020 output will remain $20. However, because of the split, the 1-10-2020 output will be $10.05. This is exactly the data a trader would see on those two days which is exactly what pipeline is designed to do. It surfaces data to accurately represent what a trader would have seen on that day. This factor value though depends upon the timeframe or &#39;window&#39; over which it is run. If one window includes a stock split (or dividend) and another doesn&#39;t, they cannot be directly compared. This is what we call not <code>window_safe</code> and why the above <code>SimpleMovingAverage</code> example generates an error.</p>

<p>Generally, <code>latest</code> price and volume data is NOT window_safe unless it is a ratio. One cannot use <code>USEquityPricing.close.latest.downsample(&#39;week_start&#39;)</code> as an input to <code>SimpleMovingAverage</code> because the values are not uniformly adjusted for splits and dividends. For example, our stock XYZ may have closed at $20 before the split and $10 after the split. The &#39;adjusted&#39; average price, accounting for the 2:1 split, would be $10. However, our <code>SimpleMovingAverage</code> method doesn&#39;t know about splits. It simply averages the inputs. It averages $20 and $10 to get (incorrectly) $15.</p>

<p>If one wants to do technical analysis using &#39;adjusted&#39; prices. Then create a custom factor and do the calculations within the &#39;compute&#39; method. Within a factor, all inputs are adjusted as of the current pipeline date.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I understand what you&#39;re saying.<br>
But basically this means that you have to program everything yourself. Th batteries included are not very helpful because you cannot use them.<br>
If you CAN take a moving average of the [USEquityPricing.close] which is as you state correctly not window_safe why not let the user also take a moving average of something derived from  [USEquityPricing.close] because this is also not window_safe. It doesn&#39;t get better or worse than the original  [USEquityPricing.close].<br>
So why not let the user decide wether they want to take the risk and let them be the judge.<br>
Especially in the case of USEquityPricing.close.latest.downsample(&#39;week_start&#39;) because it is directly derived from  [USEquityPricing.close].</p>

<p>I understand what you&#39;re saying. Let window_safe=False be the default but give the user an opportunity to change this if they judge this can be done safely.<br>
I think a lot of users would agree and be very happy with a possibility to change this.</p>

<p>By the way: thanks for the quick reaction!  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>There is subtle difference between the following two statements which is why the first is valid and the second is not.</p>

<pre><code># valid window_safe BoundColumn  
my_data_sma = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[USEquityPricing.close], window_length=20)

# not valid not window_safe Factor  
my_latest_sma = SimpleMovingAverage(inputs=[USEquityPricing.close.latest.downsample(&#39;week_start&#39;) ], window_length=20)

</code></pre>

<p>In the first statement, the input parameter <code>USEquityPricing.close</code> is a <code>BoundColumn</code>. Notice there is no <code>latest</code> attribute. This can be thought of a series of close prices. The BoundColumn object is smart enough to adjust all the prices in the series as of the end date. It passes this entire series of adjusted prices to the SimpleMovingAverage method which can be safely averaged. BoundColumns are always window_safe because of this.</p>

<p>In the second statement, the input parameter <code>USEquityPricing.close.latest.downsample(&#39;week_start&#39;)</code> is a <code>Factor</code>. This can be thought of as a single value which is the latest (downsampled) close price. The <code>latest</code> attribute returns the close price on each particular day. It is NOT adjusted (or more precisely it is adjusted as of that day which results in no adjustment). It will pass the latest (unadjusted) value to the SimpleMovingAverage, one value for each day. These individual values cannot be safely averaged. The <code>latest</code> pricing factors are never window_safe because of this.</p>

<p>It would be great if  one wouldn&#39;t need to be so specific and keep track of using adjusted prices or not (ie window_safe). However, that is part of the strength of Quantopian. The platform tries very hard to ensure all data is surfaced as a trader would have seen on each trading day, and to ensure there is no lookahead bias or wrong calculations introduced by price adjustments.  </p>

I appreciate the great work you are doing but it is sometimes hard to fully understand all the finesses.</p>

<p>One last question though: wouldn&#39;t it be better then to downsample off of the bound column USEquityPricing.close instead of the Factor USEquityPricing.close.latest?  </p>
