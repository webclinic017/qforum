<p>This algorithm computes the P/E ratio every day using the current S&amp;P price and most recent S&amp;P earnings per share. If the current P/E ratio is higher than its historical average, then we would expect the stock price to go down, so we short.

<p>The earnings look pretty crazy because at least in these backtests, this is a good predictor of days the S&amp;P crashes. It often goes long periods of time without trading, so it may be best to pair this with another signal or strategy.</p>

<p>Clone the algo and play around with it, and let me know if you have any questions!</p>

<p>EDIT: Simon has pointed out below that this would not be realistic for live trading, since I didn&#39;t account for earning announcement delay. I still believe this idea has merit, however, due to the nature of the ratio.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hello, Gus Gordon,<br>
Thank you for sharing this very interesting algorithm. May I ask you a question? It seems to me the S&amp;P 500 quarterly earnings are released much later than a quarter&#39;s ending, e.g., 1st quarter of 2014 ends on 3/31, but the earning for this quarter is not released until 7/15. This algorithm is using this earning data right after 3/31. Wouldn&#39;t this be a look-ahead bias?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Thanks everyone.</p>

<p>WJ, S&amp;P doesn&#39;t release the total S&amp;P 500 earnings themselves until later. However, the companies that constitute the S&amp;P release their earnings throughout the quarter, and these earnings could be calculated accordingly, albeit more difficultly. In fact, the data I imported could be much more accurate with some effort. Some companies may release their earnings two or three months earlier than the report date in the CSV. It would be possible to have a total S&amp;P 500 earnings that is updated every day, where the newest earnings for a company override the older earnings, then the total S&amp;P earnings is recalculated. It would be more practical to only live trade with this, because current data is relatively available online. Backtesting would be much more difficult because it would be a pain to gather past data and compile everything together. But I think if I were to live trade, the best way would be to have some way to compute the most recent possible S&amp;P earnings like I said. It&#39;s just difficult with the changing stocks in the index. There may be an existing solution, but I haven&#39;t looked around much. Also, some sources for the PE ratio seem to calculate it differently. I believe many places online use operational EPS whereas I&#39;m using reported EPS, which seems to work better from my tests.</p>

<p>Chandra, look here: <a href="http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500">http://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500</a><br>
Click the additional info tab on the left. That&#39;s where I got it from for backtesting purposes. For live purposes, I&#39;m guessing there is a good source somewhere, but it may be best to calculate it yourself. See my reply to WJ just above.</p>

<p>Gary that is so cool! I didn&#39;t see that.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>So WJ&#39;s reply prompted me to try a quick backtest with dates in the csv timeshifted by 3.5 months.<br>
The results are about as bad as you&#39;d probably imagine... completely missed timings on most crashes. </p>

<p>Looks like some kind of custom real-time earnings data gathering will be necessary to get close to the results in the earlier backtests.<br>
Possible feature request maybe? It&#39;d be nice to have access to earnings information and other fundamentals straight from the API.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Interesting Lewis. Some of those earnings can be as much as 6th months old which is no good! The way I have it in the backtest, the data is already late. The issue is just that S&amp;P doesn&#39;t release the aggregate earnings themselves until later — they can be calculated much earlier, daily. See my reply to WJ above if you haven&#39;t already. Yes, fundamental data would be a very important feature, I absolutely agree.</p>

<p>WJ, glad I could help, let me know of any other questions/ideas.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I think you cannot use the published earnings without delaying, you are definitely, <em>definitely</em> introducing look-ahead bias that way - the date on that spreadsheet is the end of quarter, for the quarter in which the earnings were earned.  Individual companies take up to 45 days after the end of the quarter to report their first three quarterly earnings, but they will still wind up dated to the end of the quarter, and the same occurs in aggregate here.  These backtest results are simply not indicative of what would happen with live trading, no matter how sophisticated one&#39;s live earnings gathering was.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi, Michael Huang,<br>
Gus&#39;s algorithm is using (SPY price) / (S&amp;P500 quarterly earning). Usual definition is (S&amp;P500 index value) / (S&amp;P500 yearly earning). Since SPY is roughly 0.1 of the index value, quarterly earning is roughly 0.25 of yearly earning, so the resulted P/E ratio is roughly 1/2 off.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Thanks guys.</p>

<p>Simon, you are definitely right, sorry for the confusion. Here is a backtest that has a 45 day delay — as should be expected, the results are about average. There is still some room for improvement however, as this backtest represents what is essentially the worst-case scenario of all S&amp;P companies releasing earnings 45 days after the quarter ends, when in fact most are released 20-30 days earlier. I&#39;ll edit my first post.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I was just wondering about this type of strategy. I am interested in using fundamental data to have a &#39;normal price&#39; and short/long depending on how the stock is trading relative to some sort of &#39;normal price&#39;. Not necessarily an MA ( i gave up on that whole idea a long time ago) rather, more  like your example of P/E  correlation. However, I am wondering, if the earnings don&#39;t change but every quarter, is this strategy hoping that price won&#39;t either? If some how minute by minute we are shorting/longing depending on the P/E  calculated quarterly, are we saying that somehow the &#39;correct price&#39; shouldn&#39;t change till we know the next earnings?  I don&#39;t know at all, I have no financial training and can barely code, but I love reading and trying out this stuff. Thank you quantopian for everything!  </p>
