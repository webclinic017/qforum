<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>We just released an experimental version of what will become our best, most useful asset universe yet: the QTradableStocksUS. We are looking for feedback about the usability of the universe in your algorithms, its membership, and any technical issues.</p>

<p>Your strategy&#39;s foundation is its universe. You want a universe to be as large as possible, but contain only assets that match the platform capabilities. For Quantopian, that means assets for which we can find data reliably, that fit our risk management, that we can use in a multi-algorithm portfolio, and that we can trade at a reasonable transaction cost.</p>

<p>Everyone on Quantopian has taken advantage of the power and ease-of-use of one of our pre-defined universes, like the Q1500US. These universes provided a set of liquid, easy-to-trade stocks while excluding assets that have more difficult risk profiles like ADRs and ETFs. The QTradableStocksUS is an improvement over these universes in many ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Q500US and Q1500US universes were arbitrarily limited in size. QTradableStocksUS has no explicit size limit, and generally has between 1600-2100 members.<br></li>
<li>The new universe has more effective screens to remove illiquid or otherwise untradeable stocks.<br></li>
<li>For companies with more than one share class, the new universe picks the most liquid rather than always picking the primary share.<br></li>
<li>The new universe is updated daily rather than monthly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The new universe works hand-in-hand with the Quantopian Risk Model: all of the members of the QTradableStocksUS are covered by the risk model.</p>

<p>Once this universe is fully released (not experimental), this will be the preferred universe on Quantopian. We will ask everyone seeking an allocation to use this universe.  At that time, algorithms that are already written using the Q500US and Q1500US will still be considered for an allocation, but we will eventually deprecate these older universes.</p>

<p>In the future we plan on applying other risk filters to improve QTradableStocksUS.  We will remove acquisition targets based on an M&amp;A data source.  We hope to add information about short availability, and remove stocks that can&#39;t be shorted.  We also plan on adding filters for stocks with pending major publicly known announcements from the FDA and other regulatory events.  Each one of these data sources will make the universe&#39;s quality higher.  Some of these improvements will be soon, and others will be farther in the future, after the universe is fully released.</p>

<p>One consideration when using the QTradableStocksUS at this time is the size of the universe.  The universe is larger than the Q1500US, and many of our backend processes are optimized for pipelines that output no more than 1500 names. For now, you should restrict your pipelines to output 1500 stocks or fewer, or your backtest will run more slowly.</p>

<p>Here are the specific limits applied to the QTradableStocksUS:</p>

<ul>
<li>Market cap: over $500M: This restriction eliminates many undiversifiable risks like low liquidity and difficulty in shorting.<br></li>
<li>Dollar volume: It is important that stocks in our universe be relatively easy to trade when entering and exiting positions. The QTradableStocksUS manages that by including only stocks that have median daily dollar volume of $2.5m or more over the trailing 200 days.<br></li>
<li>Prior day&#39;s close: If a stock&#39;s price is lower than $5, the bid-ask spread becomes larger relative to the price, and the transaction cost becomes too high.<br></li>
<li>200 days of price and volume: If a stock has missing data for the previous 200 days, the company is excluded. This targets stocks with trading halts, IPOs, and other situations that make them harder to assess.<br></li>
<li>Primary/Common share: The QTradableStocksUS chooses a single share class for each company. The criteria is to find the common share with the most dollar volume.<br></li>
<li>ADRs, Limited Partnerships: QTradableStocksUS excludes ADRs and LPs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Attached is a notebook that uses the QTradableStocksUS and explores the membership of the universe.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi @Josh,<br>
May i suggest trying a slight change in the criteria for acceptance into the &quot;Qtradable&quot; universe:</p>

<p>a) Add the constraint that the stock is optionable, i.e. actually has exchange-traded options. Even though we are not working with options data, the fact that a stock actually has tradable options has a (generally desirable) impact on its characteristics.   </p>

<p>b) Remove the Market Cap constraint and increase the minimum required dolar-volume liquidity instead.  </p>

<p>This, plus item a) should help to ensure that stocks can be shorted, and avoids the problem that, with the Mkt Cap constraint, some fast-growing and heavily-traded but still small cap growth stocks that could be desirable additions to the portfolio are excluded just because their MktCap has not yet risen to a sufficient level. After all, if they can be shorted and they are sufficiently liquid, then the market cap constraint is both  unnecessary and potentially more limiting than need be.</p>

<p>c) I completely agree with the attempt to keep Bid-Ask spreads and therefore transaction costs / slippage within reasonable bounds. However I&#39;m not sure that the $5 price limit is the best way to do this. Of course bid-ask spread is a function of supply &amp; demand for the stock and, at least based on the limited research that I have done on it , it appears that Dollar-Volume liquidity is actually a better indicator of expected bid-ask spread than is price alone.  If a stock is highly liquid, heavily traded and therefore has a small bid-ask, then why exclude it just because the price is below $5?    So as a further recommendation, may i suggest replacing the $5 minimum price limit with a more stringent dollar-volume liquidity constraint instead.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi @Burrito Dan, thanks for the heads-up on this.<br>
Actually i also found the same thing happened to me on my first 3 algos, all of which used the standard Q1500US universe. It&#39;s usually (but not always) the transient start-up behavior that blows the leverage above the target. I investigated by getting a custom output plot of a 10x zoomed up view of the % difference between target leverage = 1.00  and actual leverage, and then closely watching the size of the leverage excursions in detail as the algo runs. Code used: </p>

<pre><code>lev1_warn_10xdpct = min(200, max(-200, 10*100*(leverage - 1.00)))  
record(lev1_warn_10xdpct=lev1_warn_10xdpct) 
</code></pre>

<p>What i found was that the leverage variation, even with Q1500US is dependent on:<br>
a)  the nature algo itself,<br>
b) the target number of stocks (for a given algo a), and<br>
c) the re-balancing period (for a given a) &amp; b).</p>

<p>I found that, at least for all the algos i&#39;m working with, setting nominal leverage = 1.00 occasionally blows out the actual leverage above 1.10 even with the Q1500US universe (haven&#39;t tried the new one yet), but using 0.90 nominal leverage results in maximum actual leverage (for my algos) of typically 0.92 and up as high as 0.96, well within the safe limits. </p>

<p>Thanks again, cheers, TonyM.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Burrito Dan, i think you are right, but i don&#39;t yet have the python skills to implement it. </p>

<p>Actually what i was mainly thinking about when i wrote the earlier  post to @Josh is the following:<br>
Most people take the stock universe as a given and then put a lot of effort into stock selection within that universe. In my own personal trading (outside of Q, and i don&#39;t use python), i turned it around the other way and put a lot of thought &amp; care into dynamic creation of the best (and potentially most profitable) stock universe, and then the decision regarding &quot;which stocks&quot; within that universe becomes less critical. So, in addition to the expanded universe that Josh is creating for us, actually there is a LOT of scope to take this a long, long way further forward in the form of appropriate dynamic filter functions applied on that universe.  When doing that, it is useful that  the initial universe (e.g. &gt; Q1500US or the proposed QTradableStocksUS) should not be too restrictive.  </p>

<p>I wrote this code because it appeared to me I was seeing a higher number of partial fills with QTradableStocksUS: <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/qtradablestocksus-volume">https://www.quantopian.com/posts/qtradablestocksus-volume</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m asking for your help with it, for someone to chart volume in research to two stocks there. Visually I&#39;m expecting it will be clear that WMS has a narrow band of highs and PG is flat. Indicating that mean(), which was stated as being used for QTradableStocksUS can be improved I think by first excluding highs. I think the problem is simply that stocks that have both higher highs and lower lows are getting through. Or, using that code as a starting point, someone might find a brilliant approach and solution.</p>

<p>Beyond that, it&#39;s useful to look at extremes in solving problems: If all 78,000 minutes of volume for 200 trading days could be charted high to low, then I think what we need might be to look at a chunk at some point in the long tail, the mean of that limited section.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m wondering if these filters block some non-price data strategies, for example:<br>
 1. Short stocks that had X trading halts in the last 2 years<br>
 2. Long IPO stocks<br>
 3.  Long stocks of companies that are about to be acquired and for which sentiment is positive since the announcement</p>
