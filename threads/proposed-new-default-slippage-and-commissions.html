Proposed New Default Slippage and Commissions

<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>About three years ago, before Quantopian even launched, we set default slippage and commission models.  The models weren&#39;t perfect, but they were the best available based on what we knew.  We left a lot of room for customization of the control variables, and later, we even added the ability to create an entirely custom slippage model.  The features worked pretty well.</p>

<p>Then, we took the ability to customize <strong>away</strong>! We didn&#39;t really mean to, of course. But when we launched the contest (when we started evaluating for the fund), we needed to have a level playing field.  We started forcing those algorithms to use the default slippage model.  The default was no longer optional.  Suddenly, the choices we had made three years ago were under a lot more scrutiny, and they need an update.</p>

<p>This revision is very much aimed at supporting the hedge fund.  We&#39;re trying to make it easier to create strategies that work for the fund, so we&#39;re making default choices that are good fits for the fund.  Keep in mind that if these assumptions don&#39;t fit your choices, you can still customize the slippage for your purposes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very interested in everyone&#39;s feedback about these changes, particularly from the perspective of the fund and the contest.</p>

<p>Proposed changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Default commission model goes from $.03/share to $.0075/share.  This change is inspired by the IB API-directed per-share cost.  We considered putting in a $1 minimum order price, but we think we will be able to avoid that minimum at the scale we&#39;re looking at, so we chose not to implement it.<br></li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage">default slippage model</a> will be changed in two ways.<br>

<ul>
<li>Instead of being able to take 25% of a given bar for your order, the maximum will be 2.5%.<br></li>
<li>The price impact will get a new minimum impact amount of $.003 per share.<br></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Graphically, that looks like this:<br>
<img src="https://media.quantopian.com/blog/slippage-proposal.png" alt="slippage proposal"></p>

<p>As a practical matter, this will mean that the large price impacts that people are seeing will largely go away - the maximum price impact will be 0.036% instead of 0.625% that it is today.  It will also mean that orders will take as much as 10 times as long to fill as they used to.  There will be more orders that stay open in simulation for multiple bars.  We think that both of these things are likely to improve the quality of algorithms generated for the fund.</p>

<p>So, what do you think?</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Dan,</p>

<p>Along the lines of Simon&#39;s comment, it&#39;s all about the model validation.  How did you arrive at the new slippage model?  Could you share your analysis (e.g. post an IPython notebook from the research platform)?  Did you consult with Interactive Brokers?  Individuals with relevant trading experience?  Literature?  I need a bit more background before saying &quot;Yep, sounds good.&quot;</p>

<p>And what is the game plan to validate and update the default model going forward?  For example, over the next month, will you be collecting data, and then revise the default model?  You are going to make a change, but how will you quantify the correctness of the change, and then make adjustments?</p>

<p>Is there a path to develop a custom model for a specific algorithm?  Say for my winning algo, I wanted to develop an accurate custom slippage model.  How would I go about it?  Could you provide all of the relevant data from Quantopian and IB for me in the research platform for analysis (e.g. dump it into my data folder)?</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Dan and the Q team,</p>

<p>I think the changes are necessary.</p>

<p>the minimum impact $.003 is almost acting as a minimum bid-ask spread, which I think kinda makes sense for the Q world. </p>

<p>but on the maximum 2.5% of last minute&#39;s volume I have two thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li>since it is low, it would encourage more people to think about open-order management. orders from order_target_percent could run over 20 minutes, for instance.<br></li>
<li>aren&#39;t you effectively imposing default volume-based iceberg order management in the simulator? This operation wouldn&#39;t happen in live trading for large orders though -- it might well be filled within 1 minute (just with terrible prices) -- quite unexpectedly since it took 20 mins in the simulator.</li>
</ol>

<p>just some thoughts!  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>DanCJ - As an individual trader, you might want to choose different settings for commissions and slippage that fit your trading style and broker relationship better.</p>

<p>Gary - Yes, there is already a limit of 25% per bar in all simulation.  You can read more about it <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage">in the docs</a>.  It might indeed make sense to look at the trailing volume history and make your orders using that.  </p>

<p>Antoine - Yes, the contest will be affected.  I haven&#39;t decided how to implement it yet, though.  One clear objective is that it be applied fairly to everyone.  My current thought is to use the new slippage in the May contest.  That would mean that all backtests need to be re-computed with the new models (we&#39;d do that on the back end automatically, you wouldn&#39;t have to do anything).  All live algorithms would cut over on the same day.  That isn&#39;t quite perfect because an algorithm&#39;s past live trading history would be on the old model, but I think it passes the fairness test.</p>

<p>Peter - Yes, we aren&#39;t taking away any of the customization options.  We&#39;re just changing the defaults.</p>

<p>Vlaidmir - Thanks for the feedback, we will consider it.</p>

<p>Simon and Grant - The proposal is based more on industry expert advice than our data set.  Our data set is of limited utility so far and needs a broader set of data.  I don&#39;t anticipate that we&#39;ll have enough data to validate or further update it in the near term.  Of course, we will make any updates that we think make sense, just like we&#39;re making this one.  The feedback and examples we get from the community make a big difference in our thinking.  And Grant - we definitely want to make live trading data available in the research environment, much as we have made backtests, but we haven&#39;t gotten there yet.</p>

<p>James - I agree that this should make people think about order management more.  We like that!  However, in live trading for individuals, you are right, there is risk of bad, quick fills.  I need to think more on how to mitigate that.  The good news is that our largest individual traders are all taking advantage of orders like <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#api-order-execution">VWAP Best Effort and Relative</a> orders.  In the fund, we will most likely be using advanced order types, too, in order to manage that risk.</p>

<p>Huh?  Gotta walk the walk, dude.  Your company name is Quantopian as in &quot;quantitative.&quot;  I would think that both Q and IB are logging everything an algo does versus time, for QC, compliance, and liability.  But instead of using the data, you are using &quot;industry expert advice.&quot;  And you are purporting to facilitate &quot;hacking Wall Street&quot; but you are consulting with Wall Street experts, and trusting them?  I&#39;m so confused!</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I second Grant, especially on the max bar percent and price impact.</p>

<p>Another thing to note: hedge fund usually combine algos, having cost associated with each algo will create multiple cost counting when combined. This inherently rules out good algos with higher turn over but could be combined to lower turn over. Hence, at individual algo level performance with and without trading cost are both important.  </p>

When market vol spikes, a lot of bid-ask spreads widen significantly - so exiting and entering positions in these time periods gets much more costly.

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>The current proposed &#39;slippage model&#39; is likely highly flawed and will lead to fairly high inaccuracies on thinly traded stocks with high volatility and in certain market regimes.  </p>

<p>Below is a thought experiment showing why:</p>

<p>STOCK A:<br>
Average trailing 5,000 minute volume.  Has traded an average of $100,000 every minute for the past 5,000 minutes.<br>
Volatility of the trading range.  Has traded +-5% of $100,000 in every minute over those 5,000 minutes.<br>
Trading range over lookback period.  Has traded within +-.2% of $10 for every tick in those 5,000 minutes.<br>
Current trading volume.  Is trading $95,000 in the current minute.<br>
Broad Market Vix at 15 and steady for months.</p>

<p>STOCK B:<br>
Average trailing 5,000 minute volume.  Has traded an average of $1,000 every minute for the past 5,000 minutes.<br>
Volatility of the trading range.  Had not traded more than $100 in 90% of the minutes, but has had a huge volume spike in the past 10 minutes.<br>
Trading range over lookback period was in the $10 range, but has been rapidly falling every minute since the volume spike.<br>
Current trading volume.  Is trading $100,000 in the current minute.<br>
Broad Market Vix at 25 and spiking.</p>

<p>STOCK C:<br>
Average trailing 5,000 minute volume.  Has traded an average of $1,000 every minute for the past 5,000 minutes.<br>
Volatility of the trading range.  Had not traded more than $100 in 90% of the minutes, but has had a huge volume spike in the past 10 minutes.<br>
Trading range over lookback period was in the $1 range, but has been rapidly rising every minute since the volume spike.<br>
Current trading volume.  Is trading $100,000 in the current minute.<br>
Broad Market Vix at 15 and steady for months.</p>

<p>Imagine I’m trying to ‘sell’ these stocks.</p>

<p>I would guess that slippage is likely to be ‘negative’ with Stock C (I can make money and sell the stock for a higher price then in the current minute), very low for Stock A and very high for Stock B. What do these ‘boundary conditions’ this tell us?</p>

<p>Now, how would we rank these stocks in terms of the ‘slippage’ likely on trying to buy?</p>

<p>Stock C will have huge slippage.  Stock B may have negative slippage and stock A will likely be very low and symmetrical on the buy and sell sides.</p>

<p>So, all this is simple to show that looking at the volume in the current minute is likely to produce VERY inaccurate slippage calculations.  </p>

<p>To be highly accurate, we need to model what the overall market is doing.  At a minimum, we need to look at some trailing multiday volume, price, volatility and trend/direction of the underlying - with some additional penalty for periods of very high overall broad market volatility.  </p>

<p>If our model doesn’t take all of these into account and doesn’t draw on a huge data set and doesn’t differentiate buy side and sell side slippage based on a variety of market action, it is likely HIGHLY INACCURATE… and we should be HIGHLY cautious in relying on it - meaning that very high turnover systems (especially high turnover systems in lower liquidity stocks, and stocks that have really high vol, really rapid recent changes in price, or very uneven trading ranges) will have HUGE inaccuracies in their backtests.  </p>

<p>That really leaves a few options:<br>
a)  Get the data sets needed to build highly accurate models<br>
b)  Make a simple model that is VERY conservative until we can do a).<br>
a.  For this simple model, longer-term lookbacks on the underlying matter.  These models should likely include the following:<br>
i.  VOLATILITY MODIFIED LOOKBACK PERIOD VWAP.<br>
1.  The average of the 50 day average price*volume (VWAP), 10 day VWAP and the minimum 1 day VWAP value over the trailing 30 days on the stock (Higher values lowers slippage).<br>
ii. Price volatility of the underlying over X-period lookback. (Lower values lowers slippage)<br>
iii.    RECENT PRICE ACTION.<br>
1.  Some form of EMA over the most recent 30 minute trading volume (Higher values lower slippage).<br>
iv. Extra ‘slippage’ penalty during periods of market volatility with VIX over some threshold, say 25.  Zero if VIX is lower then this.</p>

<p>It’s likely that the above four can just be put into a ‘slippage calculator.’   </p>

<p>If you lack accurate data and can only use 2 of these and a &#39;guestimate&#39;, I would say that a) and b) likely matter more then the others.  These seem more likely to be getting at how the algos of ‘market makers’ and various market participants are making their ‘fill order’ decisions.   Not having a ‘volatility component’ seems a real mistake.  </p>

<p>Until a long period of real data exists, covering 1 full market cycle with periods of huge vol (so at least 5 years), the defaults for Quantopian should be conservatively high with the ability for users to manually set them in their own sims and trading systems.  </p>

<p>People can do what they want in their private trading, but for the fund the above seem to make sense.  </p>
