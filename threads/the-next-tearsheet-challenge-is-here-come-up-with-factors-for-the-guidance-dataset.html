<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>Our recent estimates data challenge was a huge success, so we are excited to run the next one with very similar parameters. This round we are looking for your best guidance factors. We think that this challenge will be more difficult than the last ones and more creativity will be required in finding alpha, but we are looking forward to seeing what you come up with.</p>

<p>Here are the rules, pretty much the same as before:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is no submission or live-updated leaderboard like for the contest. To enter this challenge, simply post an <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/an-updated-method-to-analyze-alpha-factors">alpha tearsheet</a> as a reply to this thread. For this, you would run a backtest on your factor and run the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/an-updated-method-to-analyze-alpha-factors#5d5d30ec52116e004cae4bef">alpha notebook</a> which loads in your backtest results.<br></li>
<li>The deadline to submit a factor is October 21, 2019.<br></li>
<li>There is no hold-out testing, just post your best factor starting on June 1, 2015 until Oct 1, 2018.<br></li>
<li>We will look at all tearsheet submissions and manually determine 5 best algorithms according to our discretion. Each winner gets a $100 prize.<br></li>
<li>There is no limit on the number of submissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Algorithm requirements to enter the challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/new-dataset-guidance">guidance data set</a> as your primary signal source. It is OK to combine guidance signals with other sources if there are predictive interactions between them.<br></li>
<li>Use TargetWeights in the optimizer and do not put any constraints on common risk exposures.<br></li>
<li>Use the QTU.</li>
</ul>

<p>When selecting a winner, we will primarily look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Specific Sharpe Ratio (IR) over the first 5 days in the alpha decay analysis (higher is better).<br></li>
<li>Turnover (lower is better).<br></li>
<li>Not driven mainly by common risk (but no reason to try and artificially reduce your exposures, ideally your idea is dissimilar enough from common factors that it will be naturally uncorrelated).<br></li>
<li>Universe size (larger is better)<br></li>
<li>For more examples on what we look for, check out our last <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYnxvdHPan8&feature=youtu.be">live tearsheet review</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules are mostly derived from our <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/how-to-get-an-allocation-in-2019">updated guidelines on getting an allocation</a> and are based on many community members&#39; feedback. Thank you for all your input and creative suggestions. If this challenge is well-received, we will continue to offer more experimental challenges.<br>
Ultimately, we want to keep improving our ability to find your best ideas and fund them! </p>

<p>Good luck and happy coding!</p>

<p>As it stated above this challenge is for <em>guidance dataset.</em><br>
But only 17% of QTU has not null guidance records.<br>
Is this challenge only for this universe of around 380 stocks?  </p>

<p>Nice first cut for a single guidance factor. However, I noticed that your number of positions exceeds 500 names while the guidance datasets have only approximately 400 names. I suggest you go back to your code and check why this is happening. I&#39;m sure with a slight modification in the way you process the factor, you&#39;ll be good to go. Good Luck!  </p>

Thanks for your feedback. I checked the code for being sure and actually, in my opinion, it meets the contest criteria stated by Thomas.<br>
However, the ultimate decision will be taken by Quantopian of course: in case it won&#39;t meet the criteria, I will be disqualified for sure.</p>

<p>Happy coding :)  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Thomas  and Ang ,</p>

<p>Just had the chance to watch the tearsheet review.  Although ranked number 6, I am glad to be mentioned multiple times and the potential opportunity of licenced algos, particularly for the fact that three of my four models landed in 3 different algo clusters, and two of them continually performed well in the out-sample data. I am relatively new as a python programmer and learned a lot from everyone here at the Q site. Thanks a lot for the opportunities and am looking forward to contribute more in the near future!  </p>
