<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>Last year, as we began trading investor capital, we publicly stated that we hoped to some day fund an algorithm with an allocation of up to $50 million. That day has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-02/crowd-sourced-quant-network-allocates-most-ever-to-single-algo">arrived</a>. We announced today that we&#39;ve funded a strategy with over $50 million for the first time.</p>

<p>The cumulative funding of algorithms as of June 1 reached $155 million. This represents an incredible achievement for our community and the work we do together with you.</p>

<p>At the outset of our trading investor capital 2017, the largest allocation was $3 million. Together, we have made great progress as we build the world’s best crowd-sourced asset management business and share the profits with the strategy authors.</p>

<p>Your feedback has been instrumental in the past year. We have learned from your strategy submissions and your discussions in these forums. In turn, we created a new set of risk-driven contest criteria to guide you better. The impact of the <a href="http://www.quantopian.com/contest">new contest</a> is clear. We&#39;ve seen early signs of significant improvement in the quality of your strategies. Further, the sophistication of discussion in these forums is at an all-time high. Two tangible examples of this can be found in our recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGnLqg_5TBk">webinar review of contest algorithms</a> and the subsequent forum discussion of <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/risk-focused-algo">risk-managed strategies</a>.</p>

<p>Together, we have come a long way. We are confident that you will continue to find opportunity and reward here on Quantopian: through the joy of <a href="http://www.quantopian.com/lectures">learning quant finance</a>, through the thrill of <a href="http://www.quantopian.com/contest">competing and earning cash</a>, and by <a href="http://www.quantopian.com/get-funded">licensing your strategy</a> for even greater potential compensation.</p>

<p>Thank you,<br>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Congrats on achieving this milestone. I am assuming that the said author was plucked from the old contest format as the new contest is just approaching its six months OOS date. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, as I&#39;m aware there are other channels to get an allocation (i.e., Emerging Managers Program).  From $3M to $50M single author allocation is quite significant in terms of confidence. If my assumption is correct, I am curious as to how long the whole evaluation process took post contest winning of author and what other post measures were done to give you the confidence of this much allocation, if not proprietary. Thanks.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Fawce -</p>

<p>Assuming that $155M is the base capital deployed (leverage not included), that leaves $95M out of the $250M committed by Point72.  So, if you plan to put an average of $10M on more algos, only about 10 more slots remain for funding.  Is this a correct assessment?</p>

<p>Any chance of getting more money from Point72 or elsewhere?  </p>

The $50MM strategy might be leveraged at 5x, whereas the others might average around 2x leverage.

<blockquote>
<p>The allocation, <strong>which includes leverage</strong>, went to an anonymous<br>
algorithm author, according to Jess Stauth, managing director of<br>
portfolio management and research. Crowd-sourced Quantopian, founded<br>
in 2011, has deployed $70 million since starting a hedge fund last<br>

<p>Thanks, looking forward to the next tearsheet review by Dr. Jess Stauth on this particular allocated algo. It will definitely give us guidance as what expectations are or should be in terms of returns / volatility over what evaluation period. Also, I would appreciate if Dr. Jess covers the separate process of how much leverage is assigned to this algo and what factors were considered when reaching this decision.  </p>
